        <p>I was born in Havana,Cuba on May 5, 1995. When I just five months I arrived to this country with my mother, father and sister. I attended Florida State Univeristy in 2013 as a first generation college student and graduated with a Bachelor's degree in both Economics and International Relations. Immediately out of college, I was hired to work for the tech company JetSmarter where I am now the Operations Supervisor for all of Operations. We are consifered the "uber of the skies for private jets". Here is where I found my love for tech and decided this is where I wanted to continue my career path in.</p>   
        <p>I am enrolled in a coding bootcamp at the univesity of Miami where I hope to master the art of coding and become a software engineer with my new found skills.  </p>
